Curate will allow you to annotate text documents.

It requires MongoDB http://www.mongodb.org/ and a Ruby web environment (Passenger)

There are a number of gems included which can be found in the Gemfile.

If you plan on using this in production you will need to change a few strings in the Constants model including the API_KEY and EMAIL. You can obtain an API_KEY at http://www.bioontology.org/user/register
